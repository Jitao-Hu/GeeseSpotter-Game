# GeeseSpotter-Game
This is the project I prgrammed in the ECE150 course at Uwaterloo.
The game is called GeeseSpotter and it is similar to MineSweeeper.
The idea was created by TA ane professors of ECE150.
My code is saved in the file named geesesspotter.cpp, the rest of the files were created by TA and professors of ECE150.
I was in charged of the core functionality of this game and TA created the basic frame for this game
